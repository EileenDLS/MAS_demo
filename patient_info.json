Our model especially pays great attention to the following features:\nFraction inspired oxygen: with importance weight of 23.87% out of 1.0, pushing the prediction toward a higher risk. The feature value is 71.0 %, which is 70.0% higher than the median value of patients in the survival group (41.67 %), and 60.0% higher than that of the deceased group (44.29 %).The reference range for patients is from 30 to 100%.\npH: with importance weight of 19.33% out of 1.0, pushing the prediction toward a higher risk. The feature value is 7.31 , which is 1.0% lower than the median value of patients in the survival group (7.39 ), and 1.0% lower than that of the deceased group (7.37 ).The reference range for patients is from 7.30 to 7.45.\nRespiratory rate: with importance weight of 18.03% out of 1.0, pushing the prediction toward a lower risk.
