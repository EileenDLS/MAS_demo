A predictive model which uses dynamic analysis of severity scores based on physiological variables is presented here along with the results of tests of the model in 831 ICU patients. 109 patients were correctly predicted to die by the model. Of 722 whose prediction was outcome unknown, 181 died. Thus, the odds for prediction of death among non-survivors were 0.376. Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Prognostication and intensive care unit outcome: the evolving role of scoring systems.\n Abstract: Prognostic scoring systems remain important in clinical practice. They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

Aggressive glycemic control may reduce mortality in this population. However, the relationship between mortality, the control of hyperglycemia, and the administration of exogenous insulin is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether blood glucose level or quantity of insulin administered is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Single-center, prospective, observational study of 531 patients (median age, 64 years) newly admitted over the first 6 months of 2002 to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) in a UK national referral center for cardiorespiratory surgery and medicine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Secondary end points were hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, and predicted threshold glucose level associated with risk of death. RESULTS: Of 531 patients admitted to the ICU, 523 underwent analysis of their glycemic control. Twenty-four-hour control of blood glucose levels was variable. Rates of ICU and hospital mortality were 5.2% and 5.7%, respectively; median lengths of stay were 1.8 (interquartile range, 0.9-3.7) days and 6 (interquartile range, 4.5-8.3) days, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that increased administration of insulin was positively and significantly associated with ICU mortality (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.04] at a prevailing glucose level of 111-144 mg/dL [6.1-8.0 mmol/L] for a 1-IU/d increase), suggesting that mortality benefits are attributable to glycemic control rather than increased administration of insulin. Also, the regression models suggest that a mortality benefit accrues below a predicted threshold glucose level of 144 to 200 mg/dL (8.0-11.1 mmol/L), with a speculative upper limit of 145 mg/dL (8.0 mmol/L) for the target blood glucose level. CONCLUSIONS: Increased insulin administration is positively associated with death in the ICU regardless of the prevailing blood glucose level. Thus, control of glucose levels rather than of absolute levels of exogenous insulin appear to account for the mortality benefit associated with intensive insulin therapy demonstrated by others.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

Aggressive glycemic control may reduce mortality in this population. However, the relationship between mortality, the control of hyperglycemia, and the administration of exogenous insulin is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether blood glucose level or quantity of insulin administered is associated with reduced mortality in critically ill patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Single-center, prospective, observational study of 531 patients (median age, 64 years) newly admitted over the first 6 months of 2002 to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) in a UK national referral center for cardiorespiratory surgery and medicine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was intensive care unit (ICU) mortality. Secondary end points were hospital mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay, and predicted threshold glucose level associated with risk of death. RESULTS: Of 531 patients admitted to the ICU, 523 underwent analysis of their glycemic control. Twenty-four-hour control of blood glucose levels was variable. Rates of ICU and hospital mortality were 5.2% and 5.7%, respectively; median lengths of stay were 1.8 (interquartile range, 0.9-3.7) days and 6 (interquartile range, 4.5-8.3) days, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that increased administration of insulin was positively and significantly associated with ICU mortality (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.04] at a prevailing glucose level of 111-144 mg/dL [6.1-8.0 mmol/L] for a 1-IU/d increase), suggesting that mortality benefits are attributable to glycemic control rather than increased administration of insulin. Also, the regression models suggest that a mortality benefit accrues below a predicted threshold glucose level of 144 to 200 mg/dL (8.0-11.1 mmol/L), with a speculative upper limit of 145 mg/dL (8.0 mmol/L) for the target blood glucose level. CONCLUSIONS: Increased insulin administration is positively associated with death in the ICU regardless of the prevailing blood glucose level. Thus, control of glucose levels rather than of absolute levels of exogenous insulin appear to account for the mortality benefit associated with intensive insulin therapy demonstrated by others.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Ensuring comparisons of health-care providers are fair: development and validation of risk prediction models for critically ill patients\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: National clinical audit has a key role in ensuring quality in health care. When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n[2] Title: Is normalized mean blood glucose level good enough for the intensive care unit?--glycemic variability as a new independent predictor of mortality.\n Abstract: \n\n"

EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

A predictive model which uses dynamic analysis of severity scores based on physiological variables is presented here along with the results of tests of the model in 831 ICU patients. 109 patients were correctly predicted to die by the model. Of 722 whose prediction was outcome unknown, 181 died. Thus, the odds for prediction of death among non-survivors were 0.376. Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Prognostication and intensive care unit outcome: the evolving role of scoring systems.\n Abstract: Prognostic scoring systems remain important in clinical practice. They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n[2] Title: Is normalized mean blood glucose level good enough for the intensive care unit?--glycemic variability as a new independent predictor of mortality.\n Abstract: \n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Ensuring comparisons of health-care providers are fair: development and validation of risk prediction models for critically ill patients\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: National clinical audit has a key role in ensuring quality in health care. When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes. FUNDING DETAILS: The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes. FUNDING DETAILS: The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Ensuring comparisons of health-care providers are fair: development and validation of risk prediction models for critically ill patients\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: National clinical audit has a key role in ensuring quality in health care. When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients).

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

A predictive model which uses dynamic analysis of severity scores based on physiological variables is presented here along with the results of tests of the model in 831 ICU patients. 109 patients were correctly predicted to die by the model. Of 722 whose prediction was outcome unknown, 181 died. Thus, the odds for prediction of death among non-survivors were 0.376. Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n"

RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

A predictive model which uses dynamic analysis of severity scores based on physiological variables is presented here along with the results of tests of the model in 831 ICU patients. 109 patients were correctly predicted to die by the model. Of 722 whose prediction was outcome unknown, 181 died. Thus, the odds for prediction of death among non-survivors were 0.376. Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Prognostication and intensive care unit outcome: the evolving role of scoring systems.\n Abstract: Prognostic scoring systems remain important in clinical practice. They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

If not, can they be related? Which is more relevant?\n Abstract: The relationship of mortality to survival is complicated and this paper suggests the two rates should both be defined for each condition or illness in order better to appreciate the projected real impact of the illness in question on patients. And if available conventional mortality data are \"old\" or not yet available, the above derived formula offers an alternate method of determining the mortality rate, provided one knows or can learn the prevalence of the illness and already has the more often published survival data. Physician lead discussions with patients today regarding such issues of survival and mortality often lead to the consideration of whether to undertake increasingly more invasive and/or expensive and complicated early diagnostic studies and/or interventions. The concerned patients and their families are many times relatively medically unsophisticated and not unexpectedly fearful. Both states of mind render them less able to understand complicated and, often to them, abstruse sounding explanations of their options. They most often default to the recommendation of their physician(s) and rely ultimately on sound analysis of the risks and probabilities of the alternatives by their doctor(s) to craft a course of investigation and therapy for them that is most likely to result in their improved outcome based on his or her judgment and experience. They trust the physician to optimize a plan for them. Therefore, in light of misleading conclusions a physician might draw by considering changes in survival statistics alone, it is worthwhile that he or she also understand and factor in mortality data that would follow in the wake of pursuing a recommended strategy. It is offered that use of the above derived formula: M = (1-S)*P provides a relatively simple tool for retrieving this more defining mortality statistic that is otherwise frequently more difficult to locate and is often not included in published reports of promising new investigative or therapeutic strategies. I propose, having personally accumulated more than desired patient perspective, it is essential for South Carolina physicians charged with responsibility of advising their patients on major and difficult choices understand the importance of and difference between these two outcome rates derived from both diagnostic studies and therapeutic interventions. The significance of these ratios or rates to and for the patient, especially if they conflict, should be conveyed to patients at the appropriate conversational level based on the education and understanding of the patient and his/her family. By comprehending and explaining both these ratios in layman's terms appropriate to each individual patient, a clearer understanding of the merit or lack thereof of the available options for that individual can be attained.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients.

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure.

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients).

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Ensuring comparisons of health-care providers are fair: development and validation of risk prediction models for critically ill patients\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: National clinical audit has a key role in ensuring quality in health care. When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors. A predictive model which uses dynamic analysis of severity scores based on physiological variables is presented here along with the results of tests of the model in 831 ICU patients. 109 patients were correctly predicted to die by the model. Of 722 whose prediction was outcome unknown, 181 died. Thus, the odds for prediction of death among non-survivors were 0.376. Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None.

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Hemodynamic profile in severe ARDS: results of the European Collaborative ARDS Study.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified as long as 30 years ago, potential therapeutic objectives have been defined from small series rather than large trials. Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Hemodynamic profile in severe ARDS: results of the European Collaborative ARDS Study.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified as long as 30 years ago, potential therapeutic objectives have been defined from small series rather than large trials. Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n[2] Title: The value of indicators characterizing the state of the cardiovascular system in assessing the hospital prognosis of COVID-19 patients.\n Abstract: Background     Heart damage is one of complications of the novel coronavirus infection. Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Hemodynamic profile in severe ARDS: results of the European Collaborative ARDS Study.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified as long as 30 years ago, potential therapeutic objectives have been defined from small series rather than large trials. Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power).

After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Hospital and 1-year survival of patients admitted to intensive care units with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes and identify variables associated with hospital and 1-year survival for patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23).

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n[2] Title: The value of indicators characterizing the state of the cardiovascular system in assessing the hospital prognosis of COVID-19 patients.\n Abstract: Background     Heart damage is one of complications of the novel coronavirus infection. Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n[2] Title: The value of indicators characterizing the state of the cardiovascular system in assessing the hospital prognosis of COVID-19 patients.\n Abstract: Background     Heart damage is one of complications of the novel coronavirus infection.

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Hemodynamic profile in severe ARDS: results of the European Collaborative ARDS Study.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified as long as 30 years ago, potential therapeutic objectives have been defined from small series rather than large trials. Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin.

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Why severity models should be used with caution.\n Abstract: There are now two validated time points for predicting hospital mortality of ICU patients--at admission and at 24 hours. The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

A predictive model which uses dynamic analysis of severity scores based on physiological variables is presented here along with the results of tests of the model in 831 ICU patients. 109 patients were correctly predicted to die by the model. Of 722 whose prediction was outcome unknown, 181 died. Thus, the odds for prediction of death among non-survivors were 0.376. Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001).

Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Prognostication and intensive care unit outcome: the evolving role of scoring systems.\n Abstract: Prognostic scoring systems remain important in clinical practice. They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n[2] Title: Is normalized mean blood glucose level good enough for the intensive care unit?--glycemic variability as a new independent predictor of mortality.\n Abstract: \n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n[2] Title: Is normalized mean blood glucose level good enough for the intensive care unit?--glycemic variability as a new independent predictor of mortality.\n Abstract: \n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n"

The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Hemodynamic profile in severe ARDS: results of the European Collaborative ARDS Study.\n Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was identified as long as 30 years ago, potential therapeutic objectives have been defined from small series rather than large trials. Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%.

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

There remains a compelling need to analyze factors that are predictive for patients at elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective study of patients who tested positive with COVID-19 and were treated at NYU (New York University) Langone Health was to identify clinical markers predictive of disease severity in order to assist in clinical decision triage and to provide additional biological insights into disease progression. METHODS: The clinical activity of 3740 patients at NYU Langone Hospital was obtained between January and August 2020; patient data were deidentified. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model that was trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (area under the curve [AUC]=0.92; specificity=86%; and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation) and being aged 75 years and over. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior, with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, and sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU-admitted outcomes, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers, including diabetic history, age, and temperature, offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features that were predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSIONS: Together, this work summarizes efforts to systematically examine the importance of a wide range of features across different endpoint outcomes and at different hospitalization time points.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n[2] Title: The value of indicators characterizing the state of the cardiovascular system in assessing the hospital prognosis of COVID-19 patients.\n Abstract: Background     Heart damage is one of complications of the novel coronavirus infection. Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes. FUNDING DETAILS: The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU.

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

A predictive model which uses dynamic analysis of severity scores based on physiological variables is presented here along with the results of tests of the model in 831 ICU patients. 109 patients were correctly predicted to die by the model. Of 722 whose prediction was outcome unknown, 181 died. Thus, the odds for prediction of death among non-survivors were 0.376. Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Prognostication and intensive care unit outcome: the evolving role of scoring systems.\n Abstract: Prognostic scoring systems remain important in clinical practice. They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055).

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

    "results": "[1] Title: Ensuring comparisons of health-care providers are fair: development and validation of risk prediction models for critically ill patients\n Abstract: BACKGROUND: National clinical audit has a key role in ensuring quality in health care. When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

Since there were no false predictions of death, the estimated chance of a false prediction was 0.0055.\n\n[2] Title: Prognostication and intensive care unit outcome: the evolving role of scoring systems.\n Abstract: Prognostic scoring systems remain important in clinical practice. They enable us to characterize our patient populations with robust measures for predicted mortality. This allows us to audit our own experience in the context of institutional quality control measures and facilitates, albeit imperfectly, comparisons across units and patient populations. Practically, they provide an objective means to characterize case-mix and this helps to quantify resource needs when negotiating with hospital administrators for funding. Prognostic scores also help to stratify patient populations for research purposes. To be used accurately and effectively, one must have a good understanding of the limitations that are intrinsic to these prognostic systems. It is important to understand the details of their derivation and validation. The population of patients that is used to develop the models may not be relevant to your patient population. The model may have been derived several years before and may no longer reflect current practice patterns and treatment. These models may become obsolete over time. As with all scoring systems, there are potential problems with misclassification and more serious, systematic error, in data collection. One needs to rigorously adhere to guidelines about how these data are to be collected and processed; the persons who collect the data require regular updates and ongoing training. In their current form, the systems should not be used to prognosticate in individual patients, nor should they be used to define medical futility. The prognostic models should be viewed as being in evolution. Many patient and ICU characteristics that seem to have an important impact on mortality have yet to be incorporated into any of the current models. As an example, these may include the genetic characteristics of the patients and the ICU's organizational structure and process of care [51, 52]. Because the organ dysfunction measures are able to be obtained daily they give a much more complete understanding of the patient's entire ICU course as opposed to the initial 24-hour period. Daily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what is truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction. These measures may also be used for research to better characterize the natural history and course of a certain disease group or population. Also, they may be used in innovative ways to predict ICU mortality and post-ICU long-term morbidity. These current and developing applications will help us to further understand the link between ICU severity of illness and long-term morbidity as we move beyond survival as the sole measure of ICU outcome.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Moreover, relationships between ARDS and hemodynamics are unclear. The European Collaborative ARDS Study was designed to identify factors influencing the pathogenesis, severity, and prognosis of ARDS. Analysis of the hemodynamic profiles collected during this study and of their contribution to the above-mentioned facets of ARDS is the focus of the present report. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: 38 European intensive care units (ICUs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 2758 sets of data from 586 patients, including baseline data, data on proven or suspected causes of ARDS differentiating direct and nondirect lung injury, and data on baseline status including multiple organ dysfunction (MOD) with differentiation of primary ARDS from ARDS secondary to severe systemic disorders. Events during follow-up were also recorded, including whether the acute respiratory failure did or did not improve after 24 h (groups A and B, respectively). When available, hemodynamic data were recorded at enrollment (day 0), on days 1-3, 7, 14, and 21, and at discharge or at the time of death in the ICU. RESULTS: Although the rate of pre-existing disease and the nature and rate of complications varied widely among etiologic categories, differences in the hemodynamic profile occurred only between primary and secondary ARDS. Both at inclusion and during the course of the illness, variables that were used to investigate Va/Q mismatch [arterial oxygen tension (PaO2, arterial oxygen saturation, right-to-left shunt, and the PaO2/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio] predicted survival. High pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and low systemic artery pressure (SAP) were also related to the prognosis. In the logistic regression model including hemodynamic and oxygen-related variables, however, the only independent predictors of survival were the ratio of right over left ventricular stroke work (RVSW/LVSW) and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio at admission. On day 2, the best prognostic model included: age [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04, p = 0.0004], opportunistic pneumonia as the cause of ARDS (OR = 3.2, p = 0.03), existence of MOD (OR = 1.9, p = 0.03), PaO2/FIO2 (OR = 0.96, p = 0.005), and RVSW/LVSW (OR = 25, p = 0.02). A high RVSW/LVSW ratio, high systolic PAP, low diastolic SAP, and low PaO2/FIO2, and increased right atrial pressure were negative prognostic indicators during follow-up. CONCLUSION: In addition to the cause of ARDS and the early time-course of lung function, a high systolic PAP and a low diastolic SAP were strong independent indicators of survival.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

The best purposes include evaluation of high clinical performance ICUs and for patients being enrolled in clinical trials. For the latter purpose, the model must be calibrated in the individual hospital to ensure that the model is applicable. This can be estimated by using goodness-of-fit testing. There are fewer uses for physiology scores and increased emphasis on converting scores to probabilities. For individual patient application, the model should be demonstrated to have high discrimination, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and high calibration, as defined by goodness-of-fit testing. Although models have improved substantially and are now based on much larger databases, there is considerable uncertainty in their application for insurance purposes, triage, regulatory applications, sanctions against individual physicians, and cost containment. Current models may not adequately describe important ICU conditions such as adult respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction occurring after 24 hours into ICU care. For family discussions regarding prognosis of individual patients, ICU severity models must be used cautiously at admission or after 24 hours, with the understanding of the strengths and weakness of estimating probabilities of hospital mortality. The mathematical link between physiology score and estimation of hospital mortality is established only for the time point of 24 hours after ICU admission. Calibration and discrimination of the admission and 24-hour models also must be performed within each hospital in which individual probabilities are presented to families. It may be possible to customize a probability model such as MPM to achieve a high level of calibration at the individual hospital level.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort study. SETTING: Forty-two ICUs at 40 US hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 362 admissions for COPD exacerbation selected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III database of 17,440 ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Hospital mortality for the 362 admissions was 24%. For the 167 patients aged 65 years or older, mortality was 30% at hospital discharge, 41% at 90 days, 47% at 180 days, and 59% at 1 year. Median survival for all patients was 224 days, and median survival for the patients who died within 1 year was 30.5 days. On multiple regression analysis, variables associated with hospital mortality included age, severity of respiratory and nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction, and hospital length of stay before ICU admission. Development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction was the major predictor of hospital mortality (60% of total explanatory power) and 180-day outcomes (54% of explanatory power). Respiratory physiological variables (respiratory rate, serum pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and alveolar-arterial difference in partial pressure of oxygen [PAO2-PaO2]) indicative of advanced dysfunction were more strongly associated with 180-day mortality rates (22% of explanatory power) than hospital death rates (4% of explanatory power). After controlling for severity of illness, mechanical ventilation at ICU admission was not associated with either hospital mortality or subsequent survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD admitted to an ICU for an acute exacerbation have a substantial hospital mortality (24%). For patients aged 65 years or older, mortality doubles in 1 year from 30% to 59%. Hospital and longer-term mortality is closely associated with development of nonrespiratory organ system dysfunction; severity of the underlying respiratory function substantially influences mortality following hospital discharge. The need for mechanical ventilation at ICU admission did not influence either short- or long-term outcomes. Physicians should be aware of these relationships when making treatment decisions or evaluating new therapies.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients admitted to an adult critical care unit and patients experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest attended by the hospital-based resuscitation team. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Acute hospital mortality (adult critical care); return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) greater than 20 minutes and survival to hospital discharge (in-hospital cardiac arrest). DATA SOURCES: The Case Mix Programme (adult critical care) and National Cardiac Arrest Audit (in-hospital cardiac arrest). RESULTS: The current Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) model was externally validated using data for 29,626 admissions to critical care units in Scotland (2007–9) and outperformed the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II model in terms of discrimination (c-index 0.848 vs. 0.806) and accuracy (Brier score 0.140 vs. 0.157). A risk prediction model for cardiothoracic critical care was developed using data from 17,002 admissions to five units (2010–12) and validated using data from 10,238 admissions to six units (2013–14). The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

The model included prior location/urgency, blood lactate concentration, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, pH, platelet count, dependency, mean arterial pressure, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level, admission following cardiac surgery and interaction terms, and it had excellent discrimination (c-index 0.904) and accuracy (Brier score 0.055). A risk prediction model for admissions to all (general/specialist) adult critical care units was developed using data from 155,239 admissions to 232 units (2012) and validated using data from 90,017 admissions to 216 units (2013). The model included systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood, blood lactate concentration, urine output, creatinine level, urea level, sodium level, WBC count, platelet count, GCS score, age, dependency, past medical history, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prior location/urgency, reason for admission and interaction terms, and it outperformed the current ICNARC model for discrimination and accuracy overall (c-index 0.885 vs. 0.869; Brier score 0.108 vs. 0.115) and across unit types. Risk prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest were developed using data from 14,688 arrests in 122 hospitals (2011–12) and validated using data from 7791 arrests in 143 hospitals (2012–13). The models included age, sex (for ROSC > 20 minutes), prior length of stay in hospital, reason for attendance, location of arrest, presenting rhythm, and interactions between rhythm and location. Discrimination for hospital survival exceeded that for ROSC > 20 minutes (c-index 0.811 vs. 0.720). LIMITATIONS: The risk prediction models developed were limited by the data available within the current national clinical audit data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of a total 1,224 subjects (males, 798; females, 426) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010. Blood glucose levels at admission were categorized into four groups (group 1, <100 mg/dL; group 2, 100 to 199 mg/dL; group 3, 200 to 299 mg/dL; and group 4, ≥300 mg/dL). RESULTS: Among 1,224 patients, 319 patients were already known diabetics, and 296 patients died in ICU. Five hundred fifty-seven subjects received insulin therapy, and 118 received oral hypoglycemic agents. The overall mortality rate was 24.2% (296 patients). The causes of death and mortality rates of diabetic patients were not different from nondiabetic subjects. The mortality curve showed J shape, and there were significant differences in mortality between the groups of blood glucose levels at admission. Group 2 had the lowest mortality rate (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that serum glucose levels upon admission into ICU is associated with clinical outcomes in ICU patients. Blood glucose level between 100 and 199 mg/dL at the time of ICU admission could predict lower hospital mortality among critically ill patients.\n\n[2] Title: Is normalized mean blood glucose level good enough for the intensive care unit?--glycemic variability as a new independent predictor of mortality.\n Abstract: \n\n"

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

When comparing outcomes between providers, it is essential to take the differing case mix of patients into account to make fair comparisons. Accurate risk prediction models are therefore required. OBJECTIVES: To improve risk prediction models to underpin quality improvement programmes for the critically ill (i.e. patients receiving general or specialist adult critical care or experiencing an in-hospital cardiac arrest). DESIGN: Risk modelling study nested within prospective data collection. SETTING: Adult (general/specialist) critical care units and acute hospitals in the UK.

CONCLUSIONS: We have developed and validated risk prediction models for cardiothoracic and adult (general and specialist) critical care units and for in-hospital cardiac arrest. FUTURE WORK: Future development should include linkage with other routinely collected data to enhance available predictors and outcomes.

DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, inception cohort analysis. SETTING: Sixty intensive care units (ICUs) at 53 U.S. hospitals. PATIENTS: A total of 17,440 ICU admissions treated in 1988 to 1990 and 5,677 ICU admissions treated in 1979 to 1982. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At the time of organ system failure, patients were classified by demographic, physiologic, and diagnostic information. The type and number of organ system failures and physiologic responses were recorded for < or = 7 days of ICU treatment, and all patients were followed for status at hospital discharge. Hospital survival and the prognostic value of assessing the number of organ system failures were compared with risk assessment, based on use of a prognostic scoring system that estimated the patient's probability of hospital mortality. The incidence of organ system failure (48%) among patients treated in 1988 to 1990 was similar (44%) to the occurrence rate in patients in 1979 to 1982; and an identical proportion (14%) developed multiple organ system failure. There was a significant (p < .0003) improvement in hospital mortality for patients with three or more organ system failures on day 4 or later of organ system failure. However, overall hospital mortality rates from multiple organ system failure were not different over this 8-yr period. The most important predictor of hospital mortality was the severity of physiologic disturbance on the initial day of failure. Discrimination of patients by risk of hospital mortality was better using the prognostic scoring system on day 1 of organ system failure (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.88) than using a model based on the number of organ system failures (receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Organ system failure remains a major contributor to death in patients in ICUs. The incidence and overall outcome have not significantly changed over the past 8 yrs, but there has been significant improvement in survival for patients with persistent severe organ system failure. A continuous measure of individual patient severity of illness is a more sensitive and accurate method for describing patients and estimating outcome than counting the number of organ system failures.\n\n"

METHODS: A total of 444 patients were enrolled sequentially for decompensated CHF from January 1st, 2005 to December 31st, 2007 at our department. They were divided into diabetic (n = 153, 34.5%) and non-diabetic groups (n = 291, 65.5%). Among the non-diabetics, there were 113 (25.4%) with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and 178 (40.1%) with normal glucose levels. All subjects received a follow-up to record their clinical status, biochemical parameters and end-point events (all-cause death in one year). And the correlations of abnormal glucose metabolism and end-point events were analyzed. RESULTS: Among these patients, 83 (17.1%) died in 1 year, 31 (7.0%) were lost to follow-up; Among 83 dead patients, 15 (8.4%) were within normal glucose levels, 34 (21.2%) with IFG and 44 (28.8%) with diabetes mellitus. Compared with normal glucose level patients, the mortality rates of diabetes mellitus and IFG patients were higher (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between diabetes mellitus and IFG patients. After adjustment for other prognostic attributes (age, sex and etc.), diabetes mellitus was a predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 2.383, 95% CI: 1.317 to 4.312; P = 0.004). In diabetics, the mortality of the higher glucose level group (FPG > 7.0 mmol/L) was 30.4% and that of the lower glucose level group (FPG < or = 7.0 mmol/L) 27.4%. And there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). The FPG level could not predict the 1-year all-cause mortality. In non-diabetics, the mortality of IFG group (FPG 5.6 - 6.9 mmol/L) was significantly higher than that of normal glucose levels group (21.2% vs 8.4%, P < 0.01). IFG status predicted 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 3.564, 95%CI: 1.494 - 8.497, P = 0.004). The FPG level was also associated with the 1-year all-cause mortality (OR = 1.791, 95%CI: 1.090 - 2.943, P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Diabetes mellitus is an independent predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF. And IFG and a higher FPG level are associated with 1-year all-cause mortality for CHF without diabetes mellitus.\n\n"

Searching for available predictors for in-hospital death and survival that determine the tactic of managing patients with COVID-19, is a challenge of the present time.Aim      To determine the role echocardiographic (EchoCG) parameters in evaluation of the in-hospital prognosis for patients with the novel coronavirus infection, COVID-19.Material and methods  The study included 158 patients admitted for COVID-19. EchoCG was performed for all patients. The role of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) was analyzed in various age groups. EchoCG data were compared with the clinical picture, including the severity of respiratory failure (RF), blood oxygen saturation (SрО2), data of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs, and blood concentration of troponin. Comorbidity was analyzed, and the highest significance of individual pathologies was determined.Results LV EF ≤40 % determined the worst prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.0001), including the age group older than 70 years (р=0.013). LV EF did not correlate with the degree of lung tissue damage determined by CT upon admission (р=0.54) and over time (р=0.23). The indexes that determined an adverse in-hospital prognosis to a considerable degree were pericardial effusion (p&lt;0.0001) and pulmonary hypertension (p&lt;0.0001). RV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-diastolic volume did not determine the in-hospital mortality and survival. Blood serum concentration of troponin I higher than 165.13 µg/l was an important predictor for in-hospital death with a high degree of significance (р&lt;0.0001). Th degree of RF considerably influenced the in-hospital mortality (р&lt;0.0001). RF severity was associated with LV EF (р=0.024). The SpO2 value determined an adverse immediate prognosis with a high degree of significance (р=0.0009). This parameter weakly correlated with LV EF (r=0.26; p=0.0009). Patients who required artificial ventilation (AV) constituted a group with the worst survival rate (р&lt;0.0001). LV EF was associated with a need for AV with a high degree of significance (р=0.0006). Comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease, postinfarction cardiosclerosis and oncologic diseases, to the greatest extent determined the risk of fatal outcome.Conclusion      EchoCG can be recommended for patients with COVID-19 at the hospital stage to determine the tactics of management and for the in-hospital prognosis.\n\n[2] Title: Individual outcome prediction models for intensive care units.\n Abstract: Prognostic criteria based on static analysis of group statistics do not help much in decisions to withhold or withdraw therapy from intensive care unit (ICU) patients too ill to benefit, since they do not provide adequate information on the features that distinguish non-survivors from survivors.
