Preoperative assessment of kidney healthusing readily available clinical tests—urinary albuminuria and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine—is one of the least used yet most\nvaluable clinical resources not only for the assessment of the risk for AKI but alsofor the overall risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

Preoperative assessment of kidney healthusing readily available clinical tests—urinary albuminuria and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine—is one of the least used yet most\nvaluable clinical resources not only for the assessment of the risk for AKI but alsofor the overall risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: KEY POINTS\nContent: Acute and chronic kidney injury and dysfunction play important roles in affecting perioperative outcomes.\nAKI is a common complication after surgery and mild to moderate AKI is more common than severe AKI.\nAll stages of AKI severity are associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality.\nClinical risk factors for AKI are similar but not identical in different surgical populations.\n\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: Table 1 Risk factors for acute kidney injury_1\nContent: Cardiac surgery: Preoperative Risk Factors: Advanced age, Female sex, Baseline renal function, Diabetes mellitus, Poor glycemic control, Congestive heart failure, Low ejection fraction, Peripheral vascular disease, Intra-aortic balloon pump use, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Peripheral vascular disease, Hypertension, Lower preoperative hemoglobin, Atrial fibrillation, Preoperative total lymphocyte count <1500 cells/uL, Gene polymorphisms (Alleles angiotensinogen 842C and interleukin6-572C in Caucasians; alleles endothelial nitric oxide synthase 894T and angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion and insertion in AfricanAmericans), Elevated preoperative C-reactive protein.

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

In the presence of common clinical risk factors for perioperative AKI, such as hypotension or hypoxemia or certain comorbidities, it is difficult to discriminate those who will imminently develop AKI from those who will not before change in creatinine or urine output is measurable. Widespread adoption of effective preventive interventions is only likely with the assistance of a test or tests that can be quickly done at the bedside and that reliably discern those patients at increased risk for AKI from those at low risk.\n\n"

Preoperative assessment of kidney healthusing readily available clinical tests—urinary albuminuria and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine—is one of the least used yet most\nvaluable clinical resources not only for the assessment of the risk for AKI but alsofor the overall risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: RISK STRATIFICATION FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY\nContent: Given that AKI is common after surgery, and associated with significant morbidity and cost, the ability to detect AKI within hours of onset would likely be helpful in implementing measures to protect the kidney from further injury and to preserve renal function.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

Preoperative assessment of kidney healthusing readily available clinical tests—urinary albuminuria and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine—is one of the least used yet most\nvaluable clinical resources not only for the assessment of the risk for AKI but alsofor the overall risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

Scoring systems have been used for years in an attempt to measure risk factors for adverse outcomes after surgery. Several existing scoring systems that measure the risk forAKI after cardiac surgery rely mostly on preoperative variables (reviewed in). More novel preoperative factors such as total lymphocyte count less than 1500 cells/ mL and elevated C-reactive protein were identified to be associated with AKI after cardiacsurgery. Genetic polymorphisms for selected inflammatory and vasoconstrictor genes (alleles angiotensinogen 842C and interleukin 6-572C in Caucasians, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase 894T and angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion andinsertion in African Americans) provided 2-to 4-fold improvement over clinical factorsalone in explaining postcardiac surgery AKI. For patients undergoing noncardiac\nsurgery, preoperative factors unique for the surgery type need to be considered. Women undergoing surgery for any type of cancer, and especially those with metastatic cancer, had significantly higher odds of developing AKI. Among patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, but not pretransplantation creatinine values, was predictive of AKI.40A low Norton scale score (a measure of a patient’s risk for developing a pressure ulcer) and preoperative use of diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were all associated with AKI following total hip arthroplasty.41,42Among patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, the use of fenestrated grafts and increasing contrast dose carried a higher risk for AKI. In a large prospective study of severe trauma patients, any increase in serum creatinine on admission greaterthan that expected (based on a patients age, gender, and race), an increase in lacticacid, low body temperature, and any transfusion of packed red blood cells and cryoprecipitate within the first 24 hours of trauma were associated with the increased risk for subsequent AKI. Attempting to create a meaningful risk calculation for AKI from these disparate factors has been challenging.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

Preoperative assessment of kidney healthusing readily available clinical tests—urinary albuminuria and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine—is one of the least used yet most\nvaluable clinical resources not only for the assessment of the risk for AKI but alsofor the overall risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: KEY POINTS\nContent: Acute and chronic kidney injury and dysfunction play important roles in affecting perioperative outcomes.\nAKI is a common complication after surgery and mild to moderate AKI is more common than severe AKI.\nAll stages of AKI severity are associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality.\nClinical risk factors for AKI are similar but not identical in different surgical populations.\n\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: RISK STRATIFICATION FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY\nContent: Given that AKI is common after surgery, and associated with significant morbidity and cost, the ability to detect AKI within hours of onset would likely be helpful in implementing measures to protect the kidney from further injury and to preserve renal function.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006).

The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg.

Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

Scoring systems have been used for years in an attempt to measure risk factors for adverse outcomes after surgery. Several existing scoring systems that measure the risk forAKI after cardiac surgery rely mostly on preoperative variables (reviewed in). More novel preoperative factors such as total lymphocyte count less than 1500 cells/ mL and elevated C-reactive protein were identified to be associated with AKI after cardiacsurgery. Genetic polymorphisms for selected inflammatory and vasoconstrictor genes (alleles angiotensinogen 842C and interleukin 6-572C in Caucasians, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase 894T and angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion andinsertion in African Americans) provided 2-to 4-fold improvement over clinical factorsalone in explaining postcardiac surgery AKI. For patients undergoing noncardiac\nsurgery, preoperative factors unique for the surgery type need to be considered. Women undergoing surgery for any type of cancer, and especially those with metastatic cancer, had significantly higher odds of developing AKI. Among patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, but not pretransplantation creatinine values, was predictive of AKI.40A low Norton scale score (a measure of a patient’s risk for developing a pressure ulcer) and preoperative use of diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were all associated with AKI following total hip arthroplasty.41,42Among patients undergoing endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, the use of fenestrated grafts and increasing contrast dose carried a higher risk for AKI. In a large prospective study of severe trauma patients, any increase in serum creatinine on admission greaterthan that expected (based on a patients age, gender, and race), an increase in lacticacid, low body temperature, and any transfusion of packed red blood cells and cryoprecipitate within the first 24 hours of trauma were associated with the increased risk for subsequent AKI. Attempting to create a meaningful risk calculation for AKI from these disparate factors has been challenging.\n\n"

CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: Table 1 Risk factors for acute kidney injury_1\nContent: Cardiac surgery: Preoperative Risk Factors: Advanced age, Female sex, Baseline renal function, Diabetes mellitus, Poor glycemic control, Congestive heart failure, Low ejection fraction, Peripheral vascular disease, Intra-aortic balloon pump use, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Peripheral vascular disease, Hypertension, Lower preoperative hemoglobin, Atrial fibrillation, Preoperative total lymphocyte count <1500 cells/uL, Gene polymorphisms (Alleles angiotensinogen 842C and interleukin6-572C in Caucasians; alleles endothelial nitric oxide synthase 894T and angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion and insertion in AfricanAmericans), Elevated preoperative C-reactive protein.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: RISK STRATIFICATION FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY\nContent: Given that AKI is common after surgery, and associated with significant morbidity and cost, the ability to detect AKI within hours of onset would likely be helpful in implementing measures to protect the kidney from further injury and to preserve renal function. In the presence of common clinical risk factors for perioperative AKI, such as hypotension or hypoxemia or certain comorbidities, it is difficult to discriminate those who will imminently develop AKI from those who will not before change in creatinine or urine output is measurable. Widespread adoption of effective preventive interventions is only likely with the assistance of a test or tests that can be quickly done at the bedside and that reliably discern those patients at increased risk for AKI from those at low risk.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

In the presence of common clinical risk factors for perioperative AKI, such as hypotension or hypoxemia or certain comorbidities, it is difficult to discriminate those who will imminently develop AKI from those who will not before change in creatinine or urine output is measurable. Widespread adoption of effective preventive interventions is only likely with the assistance of a test or tests that can be quickly done at the bedside and that reliably discern those patients at increased risk for AKI from those at low risk.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: RISK FACTORS FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY_3\nContent: Some perioperative risk indicators consider CKD an important prognostic factor in postoperative risk assessment, whereas others do not. One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: Table 1 Risk factors for acute kidney injury_1\nContent: Cardiac surgery: Preoperative Risk Factors: Advanced age, Female sex, Baseline renal function, Diabetes mellitus, Poor glycemic control, Congestive heart failure, Low ejection fraction, Peripheral vascular disease, Intra-aortic balloon pump use, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Peripheral vascular disease, Hypertension, Lower preoperative hemoglobin, Atrial fibrillation, Preoperative total lymphocyte count <1500 cells/uL, Gene polymorphisms (Alleles angiotensinogen 842C and interleukin6-572C in Caucasians; alleles endothelial nitric oxide synthase 894T and angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion and insertion in AfricanAmericans), Elevated preoperative C-reactive protein.

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: RISK STRATIFICATION FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY\nContent: Given that AKI is common after surgery, and associated with significant morbidity and cost, the ability to detect AKI within hours of onset would likely be helpful in implementing measures to protect the kidney from further injury and to preserve renal function.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

Preoperative assessment of kidney healthusing readily available clinical tests—urinary albuminuria and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine—is one of the least used yet most\nvaluable clinical resources not only for the assessment of the risk for AKI but alsofor the overall risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

Preoperative assessment of kidney healthusing readily available clinical tests—urinary albuminuria and estimated glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR) using serum creatinine—is one of the least used yet most\nvaluable clinical resources not only for the assessment of the risk for AKI but alsofor the overall risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. CKD affects 5% ofthe US population\n44and is an independent predictor of mortality and cardiovascular\nevents.45A systematic review of 31 cohort studies of patients undergoing elective surgery demonstrated a graded relationship between CKD severity and postoperative death, comparable to that seen with diabetes, stroke, and coronary disease. In a recent analysis of the ACS NSQIP database, the adjusted hazard ratio for 30-day mortality ranged from 2.30 for stage 3 CKD to 3.05 for stage 5 CKD compared withno CKD. Furthermore, preoperative proteinuria, independent of preoperative eGFR\nand other comorbidities, was not only associated with the risk of AKI but also a\npowerful independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease after cardiac surgery. However, the importance of CKD as a perioperative risk factor is still not widely appreciated among physicians involved in perioperative decision-making.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

In the presence of common clinical risk factors for perioperative AKI, such as hypotension or hypoxemia or certain comorbidities, it is difficult to discriminate those who will imminently develop AKI from those who will not before change in creatinine or urine output is measurable. Widespread adoption of effective preventive interventions is only likely with the assistance of a test or tests that can be quickly done at the bedside and that reliably discern those patients at increased risk for AKI from those at low risk.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: RISK FACTORS FOR ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY_3\nContent: Some perioperative risk indicators consider CKD an important prognostic factor in postoperative risk assessment, whereas others do not. One difficulty in increasing the awareness of CKD as an important perioperative risk factor is the complicated relationship between serum creatinine and eGFR calculated with commonly used estimation equations such as the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. Especially among women and the elderly, the serum creatinine alone may not give an accurate picture of CKD because creatinine values within normal limits may correspond to a low eGFR. Thus, in the perioperative setting, use of estimation equations to assess eGFR, rather than relying on serum creatinine values alone, is a strategy to assure that CKD is appropriately assessed as a risk factor for not only AKI but also overall postoperative mortality.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: KEY POINTS\nContent: Acute and chronic kidney injury and dysfunction play important roles in affecting perioperative outcomes.\nAKI is a common complication after surgery and mild to moderate AKI is more common than severe AKI.\nAll stages of AKI severity are associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity and mortality.\nClinical risk factors for AKI are similar but not identical in different surgical populations.\n\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n[3] Protocol Type: Acute_Kidney\nTitle: Table 1 Risk factors for acute kidney injury_1\nContent: Cardiac surgery: Preoperative Risk Factors: Advanced age, Female sex, Baseline renal function, Diabetes mellitus, Poor glycemic control, Congestive heart failure, Low ejection fraction, Peripheral vascular disease, Intra-aortic balloon pump use, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Peripheral vascular disease, Hypertension, Lower preoperative hemoglobin, Atrial fibrillation, Preoperative total lymphocyte count <1500 cells/uL, Gene polymorphisms (Alleles angiotensinogen 842C and interleukin6-572C in Caucasians; alleles endothelial nitric oxide synthase 894T and angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion and insertion in AfricanAmericans), Elevated preoperative C-reactive protein.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed.

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"

The use of off-pump technique in cardiac surgery has demonstrated benefit in randomized control trials and meta-analyses. Two large meta-analyses and a systematic review have showed that intraoperative interventions associated with goal-directed fluid management were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of all severity stages of AKI. Initiating appropriate hemodynamic monitoring to allow the anesthesiologist to optimize intravascular volume, cardiac output, or oxygen delivery in high-risk patients resulted in a decreased risk of perioperative AKI if started preoperatively (odds ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.94; P 5 .02) or intraoperatively (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27–0.81; P 5 .006). One contentious and unresolved issue in goal-directed fluid management and resuscitation is the optimal endpoint and how to measure it. An optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) for the kidney at risk for AKI is unknown and may be different from that obtained peripherally. The ability to assess renal perfusion at the bedside using Doppler ultrasound may provide better fluid and vasoactive medication management for the unstable patient at risk for AKI. One study in patients with septic shock showed that RRI decreased significantly when MAP was increased using norepinephrine from 65 to 75 mm Hg. Another prospective study of patients who had experienced sustained hypotension showed that an average MAP between 72 and 82 mm Hg during the first 3 days after hypotension was associated with a lower incidence of RIFLE-AKI compared with patients with an average MAP less than 72 mm Hg. Further studies exploring the optimal resuscitation endpoints for the kidney to prevent AKI, and how to measure those endpoints, are needed. Another interesting meta-analysis involving 1600 patients in 10 trials demonstrated that volatile anesthetics may provide renal protection in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and supports the notion that further research of high methodologic quality is needed to define optimal intraoperative management of patients at high risk of AKI.\n\n"
